				<h2>Generic Resources</h2>

				<p>The web is a vast resource of knowledge and not everything can be summed up into the categories I have in my navigation menu.  Here you'll find resources that are broad in scope.</p>

				<h2>Stack Overflow</h2>

				<p><a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a><p>

				<p>You've got questions?  They've got answers.  Ask a good question and you'll have a response in minutes.  Just be responsible and do your research, Stack Overflow is a bit harsh on those who ask the same questions that have been answered time and time again.  Stack Overflow, through <a href="https://stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">Stack Exchange</a> also provides answers to questions from a myriad of topics from Astronamy to user interfaces to world building for fantasy and sci-fi writers.  Furthermore, if you're looking for a job, Stack Overflow has job search functions.</p>

				<h2>Reddit</h2>

				<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/" target="_blank">/r/learnprogramming</a></p>

				<p>It's a known law of the internet that if it exists, there's a subreddit for it.  From /r/learnprogramming, you can ask questions, find more resources and maybe when you're more proficient, answer questions too.  There are a multitude of other subreddits you can try if you want to poke around</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/" target="_blank">Learn Python</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/" target="_blank">Learn JavaScript</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/" target="_blank">Daily Programmer</a></li>
				</ul>

				<p>Just to name a few.  Just type /r/ and your desired programming language, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/" target="_blank">/r/swift</a>, and you're likely to find a subreddit for it.  Use the search function, there are subreddits for computer science, web development, web design, code challengers and so on and so forth.</p>

				<h2>CS50 on EdX</h2>

				<p><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x" target="_blank">CS50</a></p>

				<p>Harvard's CS50 course is a great starting point for any web developer or software engineer, giving you a good foundation in computer science to get you going.  It comes with approximately 20 hours of lecture, with numerous shorts and seminars to supplement the class.  They also provide challenging problem sets.  There's a certificate if you feel the price is worth it, but accessing the content itself is free.  Also available on iTunes University.</p>

				<h2>Code Academy</h2>

				<p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/all" target="_blank">Code Academy</a>

				<p>If you've never programmed before, Code Academy is a great resource to get started.  By running you through the basics, they get you use to the syntax and vocabulary of the languages.  They provide tutorials for HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript and numerous other languages.  However, I would only use Code Academy as a starting point and move on to more robust tutorials once I felt comfortable.</p>

				<h2>Treehouse</h2>

				<p><a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/home" target="_blank">Team Treehouse</a>

				<p>If you're willing to spend a bit of money, Treehouse is about $20 a month.  But for that cost you get hours of indepth tracks and tutorials covering a whole range of software engineering from front end web development to iOS app development and everywhere in between.</p>

				<h2>Udemy</h2>

				<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com" target="_blank">Udemy</a></p>

				<p>Udemy is a great resource for courses ranging from web development and programming, to writing and business and mathematics and everything in between.  While they can be pricey, at a round $100 to $200 per course, they frequently have sales where those prices go all the way down to $10, so keep an eye on Udemy if you find anything there that strikes your fancy.</p>

				<h2>Udacity</h2>

				<p><a href="https://www.udacity.com" target="_blank">Udacity</a></p>

				<p>Udacity's Nano Degree programs promise employment and they help you find a job as well.  But their Nano Degrees do come at a cost of around $300.  However, they do have numerous courses you can take for free.  </p>

				<h2>Coursera</h2>

				<p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera</a></p>

				<p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a></p>
